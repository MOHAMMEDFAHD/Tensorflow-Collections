# 🧠✨ TensorFlow Projects Hub

Welcome to the **TensorFlow Projects Hub** — a comprehensive and continually expanding repository of deep learning projects implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.  

This collection is designed for **machine learning practitioners, researchers, and students** who want to **learn, teach, replicate, and expand** their understanding of deep neural networks using real-world datasets and architectures.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository acts as a centralized vault of:

* 📈 **End-to-End ML Projects** (Regression, Classification, Image Recognition)
* 🧩 **Replications of Landmark Research Papers** in TensorFlow (e.g., ResNet, DenseNet, Wide ResNet)
* 🧪 **Simplified Educational Architectures** for learning core concepts
* 📊 **Fully Visualized Pipelines** including EDA, Training Metrics, ROC, Confusion Matrix
* 📎 **Best Practices in Preprocessing, Evaluation, and Model Design**

Each project is modular, easy to read, and thoroughly commented to aid understanding and experimentation.
